### Build & Test
```bash
# Build the entire project
./gradlew build

# Run specific tests
./gradlew :opensearch:test --tests <TestClassName>

# Run integration tests
./gradlew integTest
```

### Development Environment
```bash
# Set Java version for OpenSearch compatibility
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/amazon-corretto-21.jdk/Contents/Home

```

## ðŸ“š Key Technologies & Frameworks

### Core Technologies
- **Java**: OpenJDK/Amazon Corretto 21+
- **OpenSearch**: Distributed search and analytics engine
- **Apache Calcite**: SQL parser and query optimization framework
- **ANTLR**: Parser generator for SQL/PPL grammar

### Development Tools
- **Gradle**: Build system and dependency management
- **JUnit**: Unit testing framework
- **Mockito**: Mocking framework for tests
- **Spotless**: Code formatting and style enforcement

## ðŸŽ¯ Development Principles

### Code Quality Standards
1. **Maintainability**: Write self-documenting, readable code
2. **Testability**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage
3. **Performance**: Consider query performance implications
4. **Security**: Follow OpenSearch security best practices
5. **Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility where possible

### Architecture Patterns
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between parsing, planning, and execution
- **Plugin Pattern**: Extensible architecture for new SQL/PPL features
- **Factory Pattern**: Consistent object creation and lifecycle management
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable algorithms for query optimization
